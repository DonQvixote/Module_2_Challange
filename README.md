# Module_2_Challange

This is the repository for the Module 2 Challange for the Data Analytics Boot Camp

The code is located in the file Stocks.vbs it is self made.

One of the limitations of the code it's that if you want to add another year data you would have to assagin a new sheet name in the array, but it works for the years 2018 to 2020.
